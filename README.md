# webUI
Webinterface to control a CNC machine with 3 axes.

# Getting started
If you are running this on a beaglebone with machinekit installed then you should be able to run this without issues.
If you want to test the webUI without machinekit installed change the mockup setting to true in the default.ini.
To start the flask API simply navigate to the install folder and type: python server.py

# Mockup
The mockup feature is pretty basic, it contains some errors but it wont simulate real machine behaviour.
